I have created a portfolio of my maze 2d game design work. This includes designs for a 2D platformer, a 3D puzzle game, and a side-scrolling shooter.



-My platformer is called "The Great Maze." It is a 2D platformer with an exploration element. The player must navigate through a series of challenges in order to reach the end.



-My puzzle game is called "The Labyrinth." It is a 3D puzzle game with an exploration element. The player must navigate through a series of challenges in order to reach the end.



-My side-scrolling shooter is called "The Tower." It is a 2D shooter with an exploration element. The player must navigate through a series of challenges in order to reach the end.
